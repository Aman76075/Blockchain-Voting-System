This platform leverages smart contracts to automate voting processes and ensure trustless participation.
2. Key Features
Transparency: Every vote is publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
Security: Tamper-proof architecture using blockchain's decentralized ledger.
Anonymity: Voter identities remain anonymous while ensuring votes are counted.
Real-time Results: Votes are automatically tallied and can be tracked in real time.
Immutable Records: Once cast, votes cannot be altered or deleted.
3. Tech Stack
Blockchain Platform: Ethereum
Smart Contracts: Solidity
Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or any frameworks you used)
Backend: Node.js (or whatever backend technology you used)
